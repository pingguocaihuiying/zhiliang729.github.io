<h1>What is a service?</h1>

<!-- markdown begin -->
<p>A service is a concept in Mac OS X of a small and efficient bit of code that can work as part of any application. All services are contained in the Services submenu located in the application menu (named for the currently running application) to the left of the menu bar.</p>
<p>Some services take the current selection and does something with it, some produce output into the current window and some (commonly known as "filters") process the current selection and outputs it in a different form. For example, a Calculator service of the filter type may let you select a calculation (like <code>6 * 7</code>) and output in place the result (like <code>42</code>).</p>
<p>Most services are provided by applications, like Safari's service to search for the selected text on Google, or Mail's service to create a new mail message using the selected text or images. However, there are also standalone <em>service bundles</em> whose only purpose is to provide services. The service bundles are hard for most programmers to code as they are written using Apple's Cocoa coding framework, which requires you learn the relatively low-level Objective-C programming language.</p>
<p>ThisService lets you create service bundles whose service is written not in Objective-C, but in almost any other language you'd like to use (including AppleScript and many other popular languages, like Ruby, Python, Perl and PHP).</p>
