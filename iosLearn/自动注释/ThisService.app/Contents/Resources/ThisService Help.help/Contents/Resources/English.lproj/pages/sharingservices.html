<!-- This page differs from the basicPageTemplate in that it gives step-by-step
        instructions on how to complete a given task. These are great for the users,
        especially if the steps are presented in a bite-sized fashion. Try to use
        these more than the basic template. -->

<h1>Sharing a service</h1>
</div>
<!-- markdown begin -->
<p><a name="packuphelp"></a>Due to the minimal nature of services, they are perfect for solving small problems well. You may have written a useful service that you'd like to share with someone else or even with anyone else by making it available on the web.</p>
<p>ThisService contains a feature called Pack Up that will generate a zip archive file for you containing your service. Pack Up will try to resolve as many issues as possible that would prevent people from using your service on their computers - for example, it will place a copy of your script inside the packed up service if the service currently just references the script instead of carrying its own copy of it. The Services feature in general is not very well known and it is not obvious how to install a service, so you can also supply a file with instructions.</p>
<p>The packed up service's Resource folder will contain any file you've put in the Resources folder of the original service.</p>
<p>ThisService is unable to verify that your service will run on other computers due to dependencies on a particular version of a language, a particular module or library or other reasons. For example, if you write a script using the Node.js JavaScript environment that's not bundled with OS X, the service will only run on other Macs that have Node.js installed and similarly configured. If your service script depends on any third-party library, please embed them within your service.</p>
