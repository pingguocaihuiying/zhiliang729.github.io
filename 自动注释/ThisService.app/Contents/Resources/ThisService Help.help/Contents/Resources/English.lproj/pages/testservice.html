<!-- This page differs from the basicPageTemplate in that it gives step-by-step
        instructions on how to complete a given task. These are great for the users,
        especially if the steps are presented in a bite-sized fashion. Try to use
        these more than the basic template. -->

<h1>Testing a service using the test sheet</h1>
</div>
<!-- markdown begin -->
<p><a name="testhelp"></a>When creating a service, you can test the service using the test sheet. At this stage, the service is not yet created for use in other applications.</p>
<div summary="How to test a service using the test sheet" id="taskbox">
<p><strong>To test a service:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Follow <a href="creatingservices.html">the appropriate steps to create a service</a> until the test sheet comes up.</li>
<li>The test sheet has everything you need to test your service before it is created.
<ul>
<li>There is an <var>Input</var> field to enter the input to supply to your service, if it accepts input.</li>
<li>There is an <var>Output</var> field that shows the output produced by your service, if it produces output.</li>
<li>Click the <samp>Test Service</samp> button to run the service. Until the service script has finished executing, a progress indicator is shown in the top right corner.</li>
<li>Every time the service is run, the service script is reloaded from its original location. This means that you can keep the test sheet open and make changes to the service script as you test different scenarios and fix bugs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When you're finished testing, or if you don't want to test, click <samp>Finish Testing and Create Service</samp> to have ThisService create the service and install it.<br />
<br />
Alternatively, to abort testing without creating the service and go back to defining the service, click <samp>Cancel</samp>.</li>
